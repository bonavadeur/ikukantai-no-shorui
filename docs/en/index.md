`ikukantai` is a Serverless Computing platform designed for Distributed Computational Infrastructure Systems. It is developed based on Knative Serving, a leading open-source framework for Serverless Computing. `ikukantai` aims to be a platform that supports research and integration of algorithms related to Load Balancing, Container Scheduling, and Priority Queuing in the renowned Kubernetes container virtualization environment. `ikukantai` offers an easy system programming experience for scientists with limited resources to deploy practical testbeds, facilitating scientific research.

`ikukantai` was accepted at the IEEE CloudNet International Scientific Conference in November 2024 in Brazil, through the paper: **FaaSt: A Latency-aware Serverless Scheme for Edge–Cloud Environments**. `FaaSt` served as the proof-of-concept (PoC) version of `ikukantai` for the scientific publication, and `ikukantai` is the official name for this project.

The permission of operational, exploitation and deployment for the `ikukantai` Fleet, encompassing all rights related to its distribution and usage in publications are exclusively held and managed by [Bonavadeur Tokyo](https://github.com/bonavadeur).
