# Overview

`ikukantai` is closed-source, but you can exploit all extra power by using tanks deployed on the flight deck of the Fleet. We have a plan for developing 4 extra-components that make algorithm implementation easier in the near future.

[Miporin](https://github.com/bonavadeur/miporin) - tank commander, the extra-controller working alongside and is independently of Knative's controller. `miporin` also act as Scheduler of the Fleet. `miporin` is written in Go and release under Apache-2.0 License.

[Katyusha](https://github.com/bonavadeur/katyusha) - Load Balancing Algorithm Implementation Module on the Fleet, written in Go, released under Apache-2.0 License.

[Nonna](https://github.com/bonavadeur/nonna) - Queue Modifier Module on the Fleet, written in Go, released under Apache-2.0 License.

Panzer vor!
